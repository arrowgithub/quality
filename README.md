survey.html - NO AD branch. Control. This is simply the first page of the article.

survey_vignette.html - VIGNETTE branch. This is the first page of the article, where the user sees a vignette when they click on the 'Next Page' link.

survey_page2.html - NO AD. This is simply the second page of the article.


NOTES FOR EDITING:
1) If you edit the first page of the article itself, you're editing survey.html and you have to edit all branches.
2) If you create a new branch of the study, update this README listing what it is! And add it to the google docs where we're tracking this stuff.
